    <h1>   For our first project, my partner and I decided to make the game Snake. In our version of the game, the player has to answer simple trivia questions in order to get the snake to move. With each correct answer, the snake moves to an apple and eats it, adding an extra segment to its body in the process. If the player answers incorrectly, the snake will run into the border and turn red. The game ends when all five questions are answered corretly and all the apples are eaten.</h1>
